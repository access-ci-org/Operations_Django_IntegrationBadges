            <p>
                Resource Providers (RPs) are at the center of ACCESS, making research possible for the diverse community
                ACCESS serves. Our providers share cyberinfrastructure resources and their expertise with the
                researchers and scientists who request allocations. This symbiotic relationship, supported by other
                areas of the program, makes scientific discoveries happen.
